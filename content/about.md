## How does it work
By the 15th of each month, creators submit either a short piece of audio or a clip from a longer piece that has been edited to work as a stand-alone piece. Iâ€™ll listen to all of the pieces, cull them down to a roughly hour-long show, and put it out as a podcast on the 1st of the month. Then listeners then have until the 15th of the next month to listen and vote for their favorites.


## Why vote?
There are three reasons for the vote. First, to give creators feedback on what pieces really stood out to the audience. Second, to give me feedback on what you want to listen to more of. And finally, to reward the efforts of the creators whose work you love.
