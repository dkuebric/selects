Selects is a monthly podcast that compiles the best new short audio pieces and then lets you vote on what you liked the most.

Podcasting and audio has a ‘discovery problem,’ it’s hard to browse through, hard to share, and rarely goes viral. But, there are listeners out there looking for great new shows, and creators looking for audience and feedback. Selects aims to solve these problems.

This is how: By the 15th of each month, creators submit either a short piece of audio or a clip from a longer piece that has been edited to work as a stand-alone piece. I’ll listen to all of the pieces, cull them down to a roughly hour-long show, and put it out as a podcast on the 1st of the month. Then listeners then have until the 15th of the next month to listen and vote for their favorites.
