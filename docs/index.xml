      <description>How does it work By the 15th of each month, creators submit either a short piece of audio or a clip from a longer piece that has been edited to work as a stand-alone piece. I’ll listen to all of the pieces, cull them down to a roughly hour-long show, and put it out as a podcast on the 1st of the month. Then listeners then have until the 15th of the next month to listen and vote for their favorites.</description>

      <description>What to submit Pieces of audio &amp;lt;10 minutes. They can be teasers or trailers for an episode or a show, or clips from an episode, but they need to stand alone and feel satisfying.
How to submit Email selectspod@gmail.com and share your adio as a Google Drive link or Weshare link.
Required: Submit pieces with your name, podcast/project name, and the best way people can reach you or see your other work.</description>
